# Maximum Terminal Project

### Program
program for Maximum Terminal Project in DBLab of catholic university.

### Problem Statement
This paper proposes a solution to the problem of finding a subgraph for a given set of many terminals considering various characteristics on a Euclidean plane.
The subgraph is required to have the maximum number of nodes while the length is limited and is not sufficient to interconnect all the given terminals.

### Algorithm
Using Memetic Genetic Algorithm including local search.
